Run Instantly's LinkedIn extension inside the GoLogin browser session that comes with every LinkedVelocity rental.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does Instantly provide LinkedIn accounts?",
    a: "No. Instantly is an email-first platform. Its LinkedIn features require you to connect your own LinkedIn account. If you need additional LinkedIn accounts for outreach, that's exactly what LinkedVelocity provides.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which is cheaper for LinkedIn outreach?",
    a: "For pure LinkedIn outreach, LinkedVelocity is more cost-effective because you get the accounts, browser, and proxy in one package. Instantly charges for the platform ($30-97/mo) but you still need to source and manage your own LinkedIn accounts separately.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need LinkedVelocity if I already use Instantly?",
    a: "If your LinkedIn outreach is limited to your personal account, you may not. But if you've hit LinkedIn's connection limits and need to scale across multiple accounts, LinkedVelocity gives you additional accounts to use — either through Instantly's LinkedIn integration or standalone tools like Dripify or Expandi.",

            Instantly is a cold email platform that added LinkedIn as a secondary channel.
            LinkedVelocity is a marketplace dedicated to renting LinkedIn accounts for outreach.

          <p>
            <strong>Different tools, different jobs.</strong> Instantly is your cold email
            engine. LinkedVelocity gives you the LinkedIn accounts to run outreach on. If
            you&apos;ve hit LinkedIn&apos;s connection limits on your personal account,
            LinkedVelocity is where you get more accounts — then run campaigns via Instantly,
            Dripify, or any other tool.

          <h2>When to use LinkedVelocity</h2>
          <p>
            Use LinkedVelocity when you need more LinkedIn accounts than you currently have.
            If your team has 3 SDRs but needs to run campaigns from 15 LinkedIn
            profiles, LinkedVelocity gives you 12 additional pre-warmed accounts with
            GoLogin browser access and dedicated proxies. You can run any automation
            tool on them — including Instantly&apos;s LinkedIn module.
          </p>
          <h2>When to use Instantly</h2>
          <p>
            Use Instantly when cold email is your primary outreach channel and
            LinkedIn is supplementary. Instantly excels at email warmup, mailbox
            rotation, and multi-step email sequences. Its LinkedIn features work
            best as a complement to email campaigns, not as a standalone LinkedIn
            scaling tool.
          </p>
          <h2>When to use both</h2>
          <p>
            The most common setup is Instantly for email + LinkedVelocity for LinkedIn.
            Run your email sequences through Instantly&apos;s infrastructure, then
            connect-and-message the same prospects on LinkedIn through rented
            LinkedVelocity accounts. Multi-channel outreach consistently outperforms
            single-channel.
