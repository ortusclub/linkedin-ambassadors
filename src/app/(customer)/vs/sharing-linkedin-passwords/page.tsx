A VA logging in from Manila when your usual location is London looks identical to an account takeover, and LinkedIn frequently triggers a security lock or 2FA challenge that can leave the account inaccessible for days.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can't I just use 2FA to keep things safe?",
    a: "2FA helps with unauthorised takeovers but creates a workflow nightmare when you share legitimately — every login attempt by the VA pings your phone. Many teams end up disabling 2FA to make outreach work, which removes the only real safeguard. LinkedVelocity rentals route through a GoLogin session that handles 2FA without exposing it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I want to keep using my own account while running outreach?",
    a: "Password sharing limits you to one active session at a time. LinkedVelocity's GoLogin sessions support simultaneous access, so you and the renter can be logged in at the same time on different devices without conflicts. (Most teams use this to keep their own account safe while outsourcing growth.)",
  },
  {
    q: "How is renting different from giving a VA my login?",
    a: "When you give a VA your login, the VA <em>has</em> your account. When you rent a LinkedVelocity account, the renter gets a managed browser session that only works on LinkedVelocity's infrastructure — they can't extract credentials, can't log in elsewhere, and can't change profile content. The owner stays in control.",

            Handing a VA or agency your LinkedIn password is the most common way teams scale
            outreach — and the riskiest. One unusual login from a new country and LinkedIn
            locks the account. LinkedVelocity rentals run in isolated browser sessions, so
            credentials never leave the owner and access can be revoked instantly.

          <p>
            <strong>Never share your password.</strong> The savings disappear the first time
            LinkedIn locks your account. LinkedVelocity routes renter access through GoLogin browser
            sessions — the renter sees the inbox they need, but never the password, recovery
            email, or account settings.

          <h2>The hidden cost of password sharing</h2>
          <p>
            LinkedIn account takeovers are common enough that LinkedIn&apos;s security team
            assumes the worst when login behaviour shifts. A VA in a different timezone, on a
            different ISP, on a different browser fingerprint hits the same alarms a real
            attacker would. The account gets restricted, you spend a week proving it&apos;s
            you, and outreach stops cold.
          </p>
          <h2>Why isolated sessions are safer</h2>
          <p>
            LinkedVelocity rentals use GoLogin anti-detect browser profiles with a residential proxy
            in the same region as the account owner. To LinkedIn, every session looks
            indistinguishable from the owner logging in on their usual device. Across
            thousands of rentals, this approach has produced a 0% restriction rate.
          </p>
          <h2>Control stays with the owner</h2>
          <p>
            With a rental, the owner can revoke access in seconds — the renter is locked out
            instantly, with no need to change a password or update recovery info. With a
            shared password, the VA may have already added their own recovery email or 2FA
            device, making real revocation a multi-step ordeal.
