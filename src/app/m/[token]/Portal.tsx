Commissions release about a week after a sign-up is onboarded, once we've confirmed the account is stable, and are paid the following Monday. A restriction in that window adds a few days." },
  { q: "What counts as a successful sign-up?", a: "The person you signed up gets fully onboarded and their account lands on our inventory — usually confirmed about a week after onboarding, once it's passed our checks. That's when your fee (₱500 to ₱1,000, depending on how it's onboarded) is triggered." },

  { q: "What is LinkedIn?", a: "LinkedIn is like Facebook, but for professionals and businesses — people use it to network, find work, and reach out to potential clients." },
  { q: "Why would a business want to use my account?", a: "LinkedIn limits how many people one account can message or connect with. Businesses need lots of real, established accounts to reach potential clients — so they pay to use accounts like yours." },
  { q: "What will my account be used for?", a: "Two things: sending connection requests and messages to potential clients (outreach), and gathering public professional info like company names and job titles (research). Nothing is ever posted as you." },
  { q: "Is this a scam or illegal?", a: "No — it's completely legal. It's your account and your choice to share access. It does go against LinkedIn's own rules, but that isn't the same as illegal, and everything is consent-based. We only work with vetted, legitimate businesses doing normal professional outreach." },
  { q: "Is it safe? Can you steal my account?", a: "No. You keep recovery access to your own account at all times and can take it back whenever you want. It's used for professional outreach only." },
  { q: "Will you change anything on my profile?", a: "Your name stays exactly the same, and we never change that. We may polish your profile photo into a cleaner, professional version that still clearly looks like you, and update details like your job title, location, or headline / About to keep the profile credible for professional outreach. It's still your profile." },
  { q: "How much will I earn?", a: "₱1,000 to start — paid to your bank about a week after setup, once the account is confirmed stable. Then ₱500 every full month your account stays active, paid on the 1st. Your monthly payments start on the 1st of your first full month; the ₱1,000 covers your first partial month, so you're never short-changed." },
  { q: "Can I use a brand-new LinkedIn account?", a: "Yes — new accounts are welcome. It just needs to be about a week old before we pay the setup fee." },
  { q: "Can I still use my account?", a: "Yes. You keep full access, you can see exactly how it's being used, and you can use it yourself any time it isn't being rented." },
  { q: "Do I have to share my password?", a: "Your password is never shared with the renter — they only access the account through our software. We keep it secure so we can quickly sort out any issue with your account for you." },
  { q: "Can my friends or family do it too?", a: "Yes, provided they meet LinkedIn's minimum age: 16, or older where local law requires. Each eligible account earns its own set-up bonus and monthly payout." },
  { q: "What if I want my account back later?", a: "No problem — reclaim it anytime, and the monthly payments simply stop." },
