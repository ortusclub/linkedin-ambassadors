// an account to its owner by email, so a second application on the same email can hijack the
// match and make a real payout row vanish). Returns the existing ids so the caller can hand
// the person back their existing record instead of creating another.

// through — only re-registering the SAME profile is caught. With no URL to key on it matches
// nothing (returns null).
