/**
 * Stripe -> ledger reconciliation (detect-only; never writes).
 *
 * The webhook records a Stripe charge only when its subscription is attached to a
 * rental (or it is a website checkout / off-session charge). Legacy multi-account
 * Payment-Link subscriptions, and anything else the webhook misses, fall through.
 * This walks every Stripe charge in a trailing window and decides whether our
 * `transactions` ledger already accounts for it, so nothing is silently lost.
 *
 * Matching is deliberately forgiving (it would rather not raise a false alarm on a
 * payment that IS recorded): a charge is "accounted" if the ledger has an id-keyed
 * sentinel for it, OR a same-amount entry near the same date for the paying user
 * (by Stripe customer or billing email), OR — for legacy payers we can't map to a
 * user — any same-amount entry near that date. Everything else is a "gap" to enter
 * by hand. It writes nothing; posting stays a human action (the amount-based match
 * can't be trusted to auto-post without double-counting the messy legacy entries).
 *
 * NOTE: charge.invoice is not reliably populated by Stripe here (undefined even when
 * an invoice exists), so we never depend on it alone — amount/date/customer carry the
 * match. Going forward every website payment is id-keyed, so this mostly confirms
 * "all accounted" and surfaces only genuine gaps.
